# Personal React Website

My personal website build using React and Material-UI.

It features 2 routes or pages, and a dark mode switch.

It was created while I was less comfortable with Javascript and React, so some code is dubious. I've cleaned up a good deal but some structural choices were just not worth the time to fix.

I'm deploying using the gh-pages package

It's also commented pretty heavily so it's pretty understandable, take a look!

Thanks for reading :)
